# Building a Spam Filter with Naive Bayes

In this project, I am going to use the multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm to build a spam filter for SMS messages. The data I use in this project is from as put together by Tiago A. Almeida and José María Gómez Hidalgo, and it can be downloaded from the [The UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/sms+spam+collection).

For this project, my goal is to create a spam filter that classifies new messages with an accuracy greater than 80% — so it's expected that more than 80% of the new messages will be classified correctly as spam or ham (non-spam).

### Summary of results
A spam filter for SMS messages using the multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm is created. The filter had an accuracy of 98.74% on the test set.
